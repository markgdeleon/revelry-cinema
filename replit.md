# Revelry Cinema

## Overview
An artistic portfolio website for Revelry Cinema, showcasing the film and photography work of Kyle Tims. Inspired by A24 Films' minimalist, project-focused approach, this site puts the creative work front and center.

## Design Philosophy
- **Work-First**: Projects and visual content are the primary focus
- **Artistic Over Commercial**: Portfolio presentation, not service selling
- **Minimal UI**: Clean, simple design that doesn't compete with imagery
- **Cinematic Dark Theme**: Theater-like dark aesthetic for immersive viewing

## Project Structure

### Frontend (React + TypeScript)
- **Hero**: Minimal branding introduction with site name and tagline
- **Work Grid**: Main showcase of film and photo projects with filtering (All/Film/Photo)
- **About**: Personal statement about the creative work and vision
- **Contact**: Simple email and social media links
- **Footer**: Minimal footer with social links and copyright

### Backend (Express + In-Memory Storage)
- Minimal backend - mainly serves the frontend
- In-memory storage for any future contact/newsletter features (currently unused)
- API routes prepared but not actively used in current minimal design

### Styling
- **Dark Theme**: Cinematic dark mode as default
- **Tailwind CSS**: Utility-first styling
- **Shadcn UI**: High-quality component primitives
- **Custom Design Tokens**: Warm orange primary color (25 95% 48%)
- **Typography**: Playfair Display for headings, Inter for body text
